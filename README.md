# KNN on Iris Dataset

This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to the Iris dataset to classify iris species. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating the steps from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation using scikit-learn.

## Dataset

- **Source**: The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. It is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
- **Description**: The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples each from three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```
You can Download the notebook using this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiarashkarimi/KNN_IRIS.git
